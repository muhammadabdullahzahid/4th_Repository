This is my first project
Welcome to the fourth repository of the AI & Data Science course at Saylani Mass I.T Training (SMIT). This repository focuses on the deployment of AI models, industry best practices, and the integration of cloud technologies. Here, you will learn how to take AI models from development to production, ensuring scalability, reliability, and performance in real-world environments.

Key Topics Covered
Model Deployment:

Deploying models using Flask/FastAPI for real-time inference
Creating REST APIs for AI services
Model versioning and serving models with Docker
MLOps (Machine Learning Operations):

Automating ML workflows using Kubeflow and MLflow
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for machine learning
Monitoring, logging, and maintaining deployed models
Cloud Platforms:

Deploying AI models on AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure
Leveraging cloud tools like AWS SageMaker, Google AI Platform, and Azure Machine Learning for large-scale AI solutions
Setting up cloud-based databases, storage, and compute resources
Edge AI & IoT:

Deploying AI models on edge devices (Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson)
Real-time inference in constrained environments (IoT devices, mobile phones)
AI applications in robotics, smart cities, and industrial IoT
